# Multi-threaded-Web-Server-
 Developed a Web Server that can handle simple HTTP requests and return suitable responses.Uses master-worker thread pool architecture to handle multiple concurrent clients, where the master thread accepts new connections and the HTTP processing is done by the worker threads in the thread pool.
Implemented a load generator to perform load testing on the custom-built web server, ensuring its scalability and
performance under various levels of traffic.
